  abstract      = "Determining how certain properties are related to other
                   properties is fundamental to scientific discovery. As data
                   collection rates accelerate, it is becoming increasingly
                   difficult, yet ever more important, to determine whether one
                   property of data (e.g., cloud density) is related to another
                   (e.g., grass wetness). Only if two properties are related
                   are further investigations into the geometry of the
                   relationship warranted. While existing approaches can test
                   whether two properties are related, they may require
                   unfeasibly large sample sizes in real data scenarios, and do
                   not address how they are related. Our key insight is that
                   one can adaptively restrict the analysis to the ``jointly
                   local'' observations, that is, one can estimate the scales
                   with the most informative neighbors for determining the
                   existence and geometry of a relationship. ``Multiscale Graph
                   Correlation'' (MGC) is a framework that extends global
                   procedures to be multiscale; consequently, MGC tests
                   typically require far fewer samples than existing methods
                   for a wide variety of dependence structures and
                   dimensionalities, while maintaining computational
                   efficiency. Moreover, MGC provides a simple and elegant
                   multiscale characterization of the potentially complex
                   latent geometry underlying the relationship. In several real
                   data applications, MGC uniquely detects the presence and
                   reveals the geometry of the relationships.",

  abstract = "Deeper exploration of the brain's vast synaptic networks will
              require new tools for high-throughput structural and molecular
              profiling of the diverse populations of synapses that compose
              those networks. Fluorescence microscopy (FM) and electron
              microscopy (EM) offer complementary advantages and disadvantages
              for single-synapse analysis. FM combines exquisite molecular
              discrimination capacities with high speed and low cost, but
              rigorous discrimination between synaptic and non-synaptic
              fluorescence signals is challenging. In contrast, EM remains the
              gold standard for reliable identification of a synapse, but
              offers only limited molecular discrimination and is slow and
              costly. To develop and test single-synapse image analysis
              methods, we have used datasets from conjugate array tomography
              (cAT), which provides voxel-conjugate FM and EM (annotated)
              images of the same individual synapses. We report a novel
              unsupervised probabilistic method for detection of synapses from
              multiplex FM (muxFM) image data, and evaluate this method both by
              comparison to EM gold standard annotated data and by examining
              its capacity to reproduce known important features of cortical
              synapse distributions. The proposed probabilistic model-based
              synapse detector accepts molecular-morphological synapse models
              as user queries, and delivers a volumetric map of the probability
              that each voxel represents part of a synapse. Taking human
              annotation of cAT EM data as ground truth, we show that our
              algorithm detects synapses from muxFM data alone as successfully
              as human annotators seeing only the muxFM data, and accurately
              reproduces known architectural features of cortical synapse
              distributions. This approach opens the door to data-driven
              discovery of new synapse types and their density. We suggest that
              our probabilistic synapse detector will also be useful for
              analysis of standard confocal and super-resolution FM images,
              where EM cross-validation is not practical.",

  abstract  = "CLARITY is a method for chemical transformation of intact
               biological tissues into a hydrogel-tissue hybrid, which becomes
               amenable to interrogation with light and macromolecular labels
               while retaining fine structure and native biological molecules.
               This emerging accessibility of information from large intact
               samples has created both new opportunities and new challenges.
               Here we describe protocols spanning multiple dimensions of the
               CLARITY workflow, ranging from simple, reliable and efficient
               lipid removal without electrophoretic instrumentation (passive
               CLARITY) to optimized objectives and integration with
               light-sheet optics (CLARITY-optimized light-sheet microscopy
               (COLM)) for accelerating data collection from clarified samples
               by several orders of magnitude while maintaining or increasing
               quality and resolution. The entire protocol takes from 7-28 d to
               complete for an adult mouse brain, including hydrogel embedding,
               full lipid removal, whole-brain antibody staining (which, if
               needed, accounts for 7-10 of the days), and whole-brain
               high-resolution imaging; timing within this window depends on
               the choice of lipid removal options, on the size of the tissue,
               and on the number and type of immunostaining rounds performed.
               This protocol has been successfully applied to the study of
               adult mouse, adult zebrafish and adult human brains, and it may
               find many other applications in the structural and molecular
               analysis of large assembled biological systems.",

abstract = {Light-sheet microscopy is a powerful method for imaging the development and function of complex biological systems at high spatiotemporal resolution and over long time scales. Such experiments typically generate terabytes of multidimensional image data, and thus they demand efficient computational solutions for data management, processing and analysis. We present protocols and software to tackle these steps, focusing on the imaging-based study of animal development. Our protocols facilitate (i) high-speed lossless data compression and content-based multiview image fusion optimized for multicore CPU architectures, reducing image data size 30-500-fold; (ii) automated large-scale cell tracking and segmentation; and (iii) visualization, editing and annotation of multiterabyte image data and cell-lineage reconstructions with tens of millions of data points. These software modules are open source. They provide high data throughput using a single computer workstation and are readily applicable to a wide spectrum of biological model systems.},

  abstract = "Many biological functions depend critically upon fine details of
              tissue molecular architecture that have resisted exploration by
              existing imaging techniques. This is particularly true for
              nervous system tissues, where information processing function
              depends on intricate circuit and synaptic architectures. Here, we
              describe a new imaging method, called array tomography, which
              combines and extends superlative features of modern optical
              fluorescence and electron microscopy methods. Based on methods
              for constructing and repeatedly staining and imaging ordered
              arrays of ultrathin (50-200 nm), resin-embedded serial sections
              on glass microscope slides, array tomography allows for
              quantitative, high-resolution, large-field volumetric imaging of
              large numbers of antigens, fluorescent proteins, and
              ultrastructure in individual tissue specimens. Compared to
              confocal microscopy, array tomography offers the advantage of
              better spatial resolution, in particular along the z axis, as
              well as depth-independent immunofluorescent staining. The
              application of array tomography can reveal important but

Asymptotic theorems are derived when the concentration parameters of the distributions are large. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of distributions of some (matrix) statistics constructed based on the sample mean matrices in connection with testing hypotheses of the orientation parameters, and obtain asymptotic results in the estimation of large concentration parameters and in the classification of the matrix Langevin distributions.

               we develop a pipeline for registering CLARIfied mouse brains to
               an annotated brain atlas. Due to the novelty of this microscopy
               technique it is impractical to use absolute intensity values to

@article{Vogelstein2013,
abstract = {This manuscript considers the following "graph classification" question: Given a collection of graphs and associated classes, how can one predict the class of a newly observed graph? To address this question, we propose a statistical model for graph/class pairs. This model naturally leads to a set of estimators to identify the class-conditional signal, or "signal-subgraph," defined as the collection of edges that are probabilistically different between the classes. The estimators admit classifiers which are asymptotically optimal and efficient, but which differ by their assumption about the "coherency" of the signal-subgraph (coherency is the extent to which the signal-edges "stick together" around a common subset of vertices). Via simulation, the best estimator is shown to be not just a function of the coherency of the model, but also the number of training samples. These estimators are employed to address a contemporary neuroscience question: Can we classify "connectomes" (brain-graphs) according to sex? The answer is yes, and significantly better than all benchmark algorithms considered. Synthetic data analysis demonstrates that even when the model is correct, given the relatively small number of training samples, the estimated signal-subgraph should be taken with a grain of salt. We conclude by discussing several possible extensions.},

abstract = {A single nervous system can generate many distinct motor patterns. Identifying which neurons and circuits control which behaviors has been a laborious piecemeal process, usually for one observer-defined behavior at a time. We present a fundamentally different approach to neuron-behavior mapping. We optogenetically activated 1054 identified neuron lines in Drosophila larvae and tracked the behavioral responses from 37,780 animals. Application of multiscale unsupervised structure learning methods to the behavioral data enabled us to identify 29 discrete, statistically distinguishable, observer-unbiased behavioral phenotypes. Mapping the neural lines to the behavior(s) they evoke provides a behavioral reference atlas for neuron subsets covering a large fraction of larval neurons. This atlas is a starting point for connectivity- and activity-mapping studies to further investigate the mechanisms by which neurons mediate diverse behaviors.},

@article{Denk2004,
abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) structural information on many length scales is of central importance in biological research. Excellent methods exist to obtain structures of molecules at atomic, organelles at electron microscopic, and tissue at light-microscopic resolution. A gap exists, however, when 3D tissue structure needs to be reconstructed over hundreds of micrometers with a resolution sufficient to follow the thinnest cellular processes and to identify small organelles such as synaptic vesicles. Such 3D data are, however, essential to understand cellular networks that, particularly in the nervous system, need to be completely reconstructed throughout a substantial spatial volume. Here we demonstrate that datasets meeting these requirements can be obtained by automated block-face imaging combined with serial sectioning inside the chamber of a scanning electron microscope. Backscattering contrast is used to visualize the heavy-metal staining of tissue prepared using techniques that are routine for transmission electron microscopy. Low-vacuum (20-60 Pa H(2)O) conditions prevent charging of the uncoated block face. The resolution is sufficient to trace even the thinnest axons and to identify synapses. Stacks of several hundred sections, 50-70 nm thick, have been obtained at a lateral position jitter of typically under 10 nm. This opens the possibility of automatically obtaining the electron-microscope-level 3D datasets needed to completely reconstruct the connectivity of neuronal circuits.},

We address the challenges of image volume composition from individual, deformed images; of the reconstruction of neuronal arbors and annotation of synapses with fast manual and semi-automatic methods; and the management of large collections of both images and annotations.

The relationship between neural circuit function and patterns of synaptic connectivity is poorly understood, in part due to a lack of comparative data for larger complete systems. We compare system-wide maps of synaptic connectivity generated from serial transmission electron microscopy for the pharyngeal nervous systems of two nematodes with divergent feeding behavior: the microbivore Caenorhabditis elegans and the predatory nematode Pristionchus pacificus. We uncover a massive rewiring in a complex system of identified neurons, all of which are homologous based on neurite anatomy and cell body position. Comparative graph theoretical analysis reveals a striking pattern of neuronal wiring with increased connectional complexity in the anterior pharynx correlating with tooth-like denticles, a morphological feature in the mouth of P.pacificus. We apply focused centrality methods to identify neurons I1 and I2 as candidates for regulating predatory feeding and predict substantial divergence in the function of pharyngeal glands.},

Here, we present the wiring diagram of the posterior nervous system of the C. elegans adult male, reconstructed from serial electron micrograph sections. This region of the male nervous system contains the sexually dimorphic circuits for mating. The synaptic connections, both chemical and gap junctional, form a neural network with four striking features: multiple, parallel, short synaptic pathways directly connecting sensory neurons to end organs; recurrent and reciprocal connectivity among sensory neurons; modular substructure; and interneurons acting in feedforward loops. These features help to explain how the network robustly and rapidly selects and executes the steps of a behavioral program on the basis of the inputs from multiple sensory neurons.
The complete wiring structure of the synaptic network governing mating behavior of male nematodes is revealed.

Neurons with similar morphologies and connectivities have been grouped together into classes; there are 118 such classes. Neurons have simple morphologies with few, if any, branches. Processes from neurons run in defined positions within bundles of parallel processes, synaptic connections being made en passant. Process bundles are arranged longitudinally and circumferentially and are often adjacent to ridges of hypodermis. Neurons are generally highly locally connected, making synaptic connections with many of their neighbours. Muscle cells have arms that run out to process bundles containing motoneuron axons. Here they receive their synaptic input in defined regions along the surface of the bundles, where motoneuron axons reside. Most of the m orphologically identifiable synaptic connections in a typical animal are described. These consist of about 5000 chemical synapses, 2000 neuromuscular junctions and 600 gap junctions.},

However, the imaging scale required to comprehensively reconstruct these structures is more than ten orders of magnitude smaller than the spatial extents occupied by networks of interconnected neurons, some of which span nearly the entire brain. Difficulties in generating and handling data for large volumes at nanoscale resolution have thus restricted vertebrate studies to fragments of circuits. These efforts were recently transformed by advances in computing, sample handling, and imaging techniques, but high-resolution examination of entire brains remains a challenge. Here, we present ssEM data for the complete brain of a larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) at 5.5 days post-fertilization. Our approach utilizes multiple rounds of targeted imaging at different scales to reduce acquisition time and data management requirements. The resulting dataset can be analysed to reconstruct neuronal processes, permitting us to survey all myelinated axons (the projectome). These reconstructions enable precise investigations of neuronal morphology, which reveal remarkable bilateral symmetry in myelinated reticulospinal and lateral line afferent axons. We further set the stage for whole-brain structure–function comparisons by co-registering functional reference atlases and in vivo two-photon fluorescence microscopy data from the same specimen. All obtained images and reconstructions are provided as an open-access resource.},

The organization of the larval olfactory bulb showed marked differences from that of the adult but similarities to that of the insect antennal lobe. Interneurons comprised multiple types but granule cells were rare. Interglomerular projections of interneurons were complex and bidirectional. Projections were not random but biased toward glomerular groups receiving input from common types of sensory neurons. Hence, the interneuron network in the olfactory bulb exhibits a specific topological organization that is governed by glomerular identity.},
